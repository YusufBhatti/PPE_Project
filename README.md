**Perturbed Parameter Ensemble Project**

This project represents part of The Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON) Perturbed Parameter Ensemble (PPE) contribution to the [CleanCloud Project](https://projects.au.dk/cleancloud). This project uses Convolutional Neutral Network and Gaussian Processes to emulate climate models. The climate model in use is [ECHAM6-HAM](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1643/2019/). To discuss the mechanics of the PPE software, or code, people let me know.

The climate models are simulated with the [PPE_Aerosol](https://github.com/YusufBhatti/PPE_Project/tree/master/PPE_Aerosol) directory, which contains several src code changes.

[PPE_Scripts](https://github.com/YusufBhatti/PPE_Project/tree/master/PPE_Scripts) is a software tool used to produce the initial settings and then run the simulations using several tools I developed.

[Python_Scripts](https://github.com/YusufBhatti/PPE_Project/tree/master/Python_Scripts) is the stage where all simulations have already been cleaned and post-processed, ready for emulating and analysis.
