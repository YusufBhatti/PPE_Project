-------------------------------
Settings for the AeroCom Phase III Historical experiment (HIST). The details of the experiment can be found here:
https://wiki.met.no/aerocom/phase3-experiments

The experiment was run with revision r5939 of this branch for Aerocom Phase III:
https://svn.iac.ethz.ch/external/echam-hammoz/echam6-hammoz/branches/david_neubauer_aerocom_phase3

AeroCom III specific input files are not (yet) in a versioned input-file distribution.

Years 1980-2014 (after 6 months of spin-up). Note that the historical experiment was split into several time periods (simulations) to reduce the time required for the simulation (all using 6 months of spin-up).

A post-processing script for the experiment can be found here:
