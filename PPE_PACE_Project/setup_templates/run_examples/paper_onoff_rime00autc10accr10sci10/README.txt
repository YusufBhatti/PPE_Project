Specificities of this template:
-------------------------------
Settings for the "one-at-a-time" experiments in the paper (simulations at point of final response, these experiments correspond e.g. to Fig. 5)

Proske, U., Ferrachat, S., Neubauer, D., Staab, M., and Lohmann, U.: Assessing the potential for simplification in global climate model cloud microphysics, Atmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss. [preprint], https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-801, in review, 2021. 

This template represents illustrative settings for one case (riming is turned off while all 3 other processes are turned on). To get the other experiments, change eta_emu_rime, eta_emu_aggr (now called autoconversion in the manuscript), eta_emu_accr, eta_emu_sci in the settings file. 

Note that the settings file is given as is, and not as a template because the header has been modified as well (that means that machine-specific parts will need to be adjusted manually).
