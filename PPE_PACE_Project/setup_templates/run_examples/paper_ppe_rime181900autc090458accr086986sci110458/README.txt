Settings for the PPE experiments in the paper (simulations at point of final response)

Proske, U., Ferrachat, S., Neubauer, D., Staab, M., and Lohmann, U.: Assessing the potential for simplification in global climate model cloud microphysics, Atmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss. [preprint], https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2021-801, in review, 2021. 

This template represents illustrative settings for one case. To get the other experiments, change eta_emu_rime, eta_emu_aggr (now called autoconversion in the manuscript), eta_emu_accr, eta_emu_sci in the settings file. 
The values for the PPE experiments in the paper are as follows:
etarime, etaaggr/etaautc, etaaccr, etasci

Note that the settings file is given as is, and not as a template because the header has been modified as well (that means that machine-specific parts will need to be adjusted manually).
